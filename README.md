## Purpose


Recent years, reinforcement learning(RL) is appliacted more and more in Job shop scheduling. But as we know, 
RL performed much more better and widely in game, other than production in reality. So the idea came to me, 
why not construct a game for JSP, where Jobs are players and Machines are obstacles. I believe that will be
interesting.
